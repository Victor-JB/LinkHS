										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3 id="mntl-sc-block_1-0-2" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text">Bad Luck or Good Luck?</span></h3>
<div id="mntl-sc-block_1-0-3" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html ">
<p>Here’s an example: Maureen Nelson. Maureen worked for Employer A, which was located across the street from Company B. Employer A was a contract position and Maureen needed benefits, so she went to B. Company B had buyer&#8217;s remorse after two months (Maureen never knew why) and she was asked to resign.</p>
</div>
<div id="mntl-sc-block_1-0-5" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html ">
<p>Maureen called Employer A back, and they said, &#8220;Great! Can you be here tomorrow morning at 9:00?&#8221; Because they were so close geographically, the commute was identical, and her routine hardly changed</p>
</div>
<div id="mntl-sc-block_1-0-7" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html ">
<p>The story gets better, though. Maureen explains,</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;The best part: A few months later, I was hired at Employer C, which paid me 30 percent more ($15K) than Employer B did! I actually moved for that job. It&#8217;s like the Chinese folk tale that starts with the horse running away &#8211; you never know, you never know &#8211; whether it&#8217;s good luck or bad luck.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
</div>
<h3 id="mntl-sc-block_1-0-11" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text">Doing All the Right Things</span></h3><div id="mntl-sc-block_1-0-12" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html ">
<p>Another person had done everything you should do when it came to both her job search and to evaluating a position at one of the top employers in the United States. She interviewed several times, researched the company, evaluated the job offer, and talked to her future co-workers and supervisor.</p>
</div>
<div id="mntl-sc-block_1-0-14" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html ">
<p>Presuming that she had made a good decision, she packed her bags and relocated to a new city to take what she thought was an exciting new job. Only it wasn&#8217;t. The position was nothing like anyone had described it.</p>
</div>
<div id="mntl-sc-block_1-0-16" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html ">
<p>The only explanation she got when she asked about the difference between the job she thought she was hired for and what she was doing, was that she could work her way up to more responsibility.</p>
</div>
<h3 id="mntl-sc-block_1-0-20" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text">Starting Your Job Search Over</span></h3>
<div id="mntl-sc-block_1-0-21" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html ">
<p>Unfortunately, luck doesn&#8217;t always work in your favor. Sometimes, the employer has filled the position or doesn&#8217;t want you back, and you’re either stuck with your new job or you’ll have to find something else.</p>
</div>
<div id="mntl-sc-block_1-0-23" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html ">
<p>For example, someone leaves his job for a new position. But he decides he hates his new job on the day he starts. He calls his old company to see if they’ll hire him back. However, he hadn’t performed as well at his old job as he should have so the company had looked at the resignation as an opportunity to start fresh with a new employee.</p>
</div>
<div id="mntl-sc-block_1-0-25" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html ">
<p>If going back to your old job isn&#8217;t an option, take some time to see if you were judging the job or the company in haste. Sometimes, our first impressions aren&#8217;t correct, and the job might be a better fit than you expected. Give it a chance and take some time to see if it&#8217;s as bad as you first thought.</p>
</div>
<div id="mntl-sc-block_1-0-27" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html ">
<p>If it really is that awful, start networking with your contacts and get your resume back into circulation. Be honest when you&#8217;re asked why you&#8217;re leaving a job you just started (and you will be).</p>
</div>
<div id="mntl-sc-block_1-0-29" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html ">
<p>Tell your contacts and the interviewer that the job wasn&#8217;t a good fit and you decided to pursue other options. You will probably need to provide details on why the position didn&#8217;t work out, so think about appropriate answers prior to interviewing. These sample interview answers on leaving your job may give you some ideas.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. In placerat urna sed eros commodo aliquam. Aenean purus sapien, gravida vel arcu at, mattis ultrices odio. Praesent sit amet aliquet neque. Aliquam sit amet porttitor mi. Cras pharetra, risus vel lacinia dictum, augue orci ornare erat, varius porta massa ligula id urna. Maecenas sagittis ut sem sit amet interdum. Praesent vel viverra erat, vitae mattis odio. Nunc rhoncus justo eu ante ultrices, non porta mi bibendum. Ut non orci eget ante ultrices suscipit.</p>
<p>Morbi vel dignissim ipsum, eget iaculis ipsum. Mauris vel condimentum libero, vel eleifend nulla. Duis a efficitur arcu. Nullam finibus libero a mi fermentum interdum. Morbi eros arcu, finibus ac rutrum eget, auctor a nunc. Suspendisse mollis lacinia justo in faucibus. Cras a sapien elit. Etiam viverra justo nec augue interdum facilisis non ac ex.</p>
<ul>
<li>Aliquam cursus dictum mauris cursus tempus.</li>
<li>Ut rutrum sem non diam rhoncus, quis lacinia magna gravida.</li>
<li>Etiam egestas turpis in egestas lobortis.</li>
<li>Duis hendrerit neque nec metus vehicula,</li>
<li>Praesent vel viverra erat, vitae mattis odio. Nunc rhoncus justo eu ante ultrices, non porta mi bibendum. Ut non orci eget ante ultrices suscipit.</li>
</ul>
<h3>1. What do you want (or not want) from the next stage in your career?</h3>
<p>Vestibulum odio risus, eleifend sit amet sagittis ac, sollicitudin sit amet neque. Suspendisse porta quis lorem non mattis. Nam sed odio augue. Donec finibus ipsum erat, et egestas orci mattis vel. Cras in ex id magna gravida mollis in non diam. Nullam elementum at diam interdum tempor. Ut eu ultrices enim, et posuere diam. Integer augue nisl, tincidunt id semper id, hendrerit ut enim. Nunc nec placerat ante. Quisque eleifend risus ut nunc rutrum iaculis in quis lacus. Nulla dui velit, elementum sit amet orci sit amet, finibus scelerisque nisi. In massa leo, facilisis a leo non, gravida mattis augue.</p>
<h3>2. What kind of workplace do you want to work in?</h3>
<p>Morbi vel dignissim ipsum, eget iaculis ipsum. Mauris vel condimentum libero, vel eleifend nulla. Duis a efficitur arcu. Nullam finibus libero a mi fermentum interdum.

<h3>Can you fix it now?</h3>
<p>If you decide that you love what you do but just want a better work-life balance or more money, could you get these things at your current workplace?</p>
<p>If possible, it’s worth sitting down with your manager and sharing your thoughts.</p>
<p>If you are concerned about the lack of challenge and career progression, could you ask for training and widen your work scope? Could you negotiate a pay increase?</p>
<p>By speaking to your manager, you will be able to uncover if your needs can be met where you are. Alternatively, you may find there is no other option but to leave.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="lead">Working alone is difficult, but group work is even more challenging. Alone, you can make instantaneous decisions and changes without having to worry about how it will affect other persons. However, group work and by extension, group discussion is a part of every aspect of our lives, and we cannot push it under the rug, hoping it goes away. So what now? How can you prepare yourself to be a good team player and have positive and engaging group discussions with members of your team? This article will give you some pointers on how to develop your skills and be productive during group discussions.</p>
<h5><strong>Prepare</strong></h5>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="size-medium wp-image-116 alignright" src="https://elementor.nokriwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/pexels-photo-1043514-1-288x300.jpeg" alt="" width="288" height="300" /></p>
<p>Firstly, even before you meet with the group, you must prepare yourself for the discussion. It makes no sense arriving to discuss about a topic, and you have no idea what the topic is about. Do your research, read reviews and see what other persons are saying about the topic and make notes. Arm yourself with the knowledge you need to support and defend any points which may arise during the discussion. This also shows that you are prepared to engage in wholesome discussion and not just coming to the meeting because you feel obligated.</p>
<h5><strong>Be Punctual</strong></h5>
<p>On the day of the meeting, be early! It sets an unprofessional tone when you show up late for a meeting. It sends a message to other members that the discussion is meaningless and an inconvenience to your daily schedule. Dress comfortably but appropriate for the meeting so you don’t focus on how much your feet hurt or how badly you want to take off this tie, but you are engaged and focused on the discussion.</p>
<h5><strong>Listen</strong></h5>
<p>We hear, but we do not listen. Many persons neglect to admit that listening is an art which they don’t possess. Listening is of utmost importance when doing group discussions and it can help to avoid repetition of points which is ultimately a waste of time. When meeting with the group, before any discussion starts everyone should state their interpretation of the topic. Often, persons start out with a misguided idea about what the topic is about, and this leads to complications further into the discussion. Members need to express their thoughts on the topic so everyone can begin the discussion on the same page.</p>
<h5><strong>Give everyone a voice</strong></h5>
<p>Getting into the actual discussion, group members must remember that being respectful is most important and that opinions and facts are two different things. Persons tend to get frustrated when their voice isn’t heard or when others seem to be dismissive of their views. A good discussion requires a mutual level of respect by everyone involved, and to continue to be respectful even if there are disagreements.</p>
<p>To quote <strong>Brandon Jenner</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>Sometimes we let life guide us, and other times we take life by the horns. But one thing is for sure: no matter how organized we are, or how well we plan, we can always expect the unexpected</p></blockquote>
<h5><strong>Take the Initiative</strong></h5>
<p>Taking the initiative is also a good way to improve the performance in group discussions. At times, a task may come up, and it needs to be delegated to a member to be completed, in some cases for the discussion to move forward. Stepping up to the challenge is a good way to show your ability to get the job done as well as flexing your leadership muscles. This allows persons to see you in a different setting and also gives you the opportunity to showcase your skills.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="lead">It is quite easy to be swept over the feet by a fresh job offer. The job offer reflects the fact that someone requires the person’s service and is willing to pay him for that. No wonder if the candidate feels a bit of giddiness or even fit of excitement. But this is also the moment to ponder over the point what else is being offered by the recruiter. There are in fact several factors one really ought to consider prior to accepting a fresh job offer. Discussed below are a few points that people generally tend to miss taking into account when it comes to adding the fresh company to their resume.</p>
<h3>What is the catch?</h3>
<p>People generally tend to take into account what they would in effect, have to sacrifice to fulfil their fresh duties when it comes to accepting the new job. A fresh role whatever it may be means fresh responsibilities that may involve the candidate’s making amendments to his social calendar accordingly. Therefore the candidate is better advised to be in a position to be informed of what he would have to pay in return for success and if the so earned success really viable.</p>
<p>To quote vince lombardi,</p>
<blockquote><p>The price of success is hard <b>work</b>, dedication to the <b>job</b> at hand, and the determination that whether we win or lose, we have applied the best of ourselves to the task at hand</p></blockquote>
<h3>Being in the right work environment</h3>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="size-medium wp-image-45 alignright" src="https://demo.nokriwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/pexels-photo-935756-288x300.jpeg" alt="" width="288" height="300" /></p><p>Prior to accepting a job offer, the candidate in question is advised to meet a few of his colleagues from the new workplace. As the same persons, he would be spending more than forty hours a week at a common workplace it is surely essential to be amicable with them. This is absolutely crucial as a wrong work environment can prove to be damaging for the career of the person. Making a continuous effort to get oneself introduced to the environment even before accepting the position could pay rich dividends rather than taking a leap of blind faith into the fresh offer.</p>
<h3>Let the new job come with some juice for the resume</h3>
<p>A good promising fresh job is not just all about a healthy salary package and sound environment. It must also accommodate something that would open up the candidate to other opportunities. These could be the space to gain more knowledge or the scope to develop within a certain industry. The opportunity part would also pack with it the promise of a stepping stone to the candidate for achieving greater things in the future.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Interviews are perfect occasions for the elevator pitch to work. This is significant particularly when the candidate faces the famous question of ‘explain yourself’. During such instances, elevator pitches help the candidate gain confidence in introducing him to company representatives.<br />
For not missing the decisive opportunity, here are some tips on preparing an ideal elevator pitch.</p>
<h2>Tips to follow while preparing the ideal elevator pitch</h2>
<h3>Noting down points on a paper strip:</h3>
<p>The candidate is best advised to write the plans down on a piece of paper to find out the relevant matter to be included and those to be excluded. Editing must be done carefully. Unnecessary data must be removed and focus must be on presenting oneself professionally and effectively for those that have very little time.</p>
<h3>A Solution for All Questions:</h3>
<p>The pitch prepared by the candidate should simply mention who he is, what he does and what he was looking for. All such questions must be answered by a good elevator pitch..</p>
<h3>A Professional Tone is Ideal:</h3>
<p>For presenting the candidate’s best self to the recruiter in front, the achievements and goals comprised in the pitch by the candidate must talk about themselves. Bragging could prove to be negative as regards to effect on the listener. But hesitation or lengthy talking for getting to the point must also be avoided as such moves could spoil the pitch’s purpose.<br />
Should be Listener Friendly: The person supposed to be listening to the elevator pitch of a candidate would be generally thinking, what the pitch carried for him. Therefore, the candidate preparing the pitch should ensure that the pitch sounded he would be a massive asset to the listener’s organization.</p>
<p>To quote Saint Basil</p>
<blockquote><p>First and foremost, the monk should own nothing in this world, but he should have as his possessions solitude of the body, modesty of bearing, a modulated tone of voice, and a well-ordered manner of speech. He should be without anxiety as to his food and drink, and should eat in silence</p></blockquote>
<h3>Speaking Too Fast:</h3>
<p>There definitely is the dilemma of presenting all his achievements, in short sentences for the candidate. Still, the candidate is advised not to cram information worth a minute or two into a thirty-second slot. Here speaking coherently in full sentences is a wise thing.<br />
Being Robotic: The candidate needs to understand that frowning and using monotone are hardly part of being professional. A smile and being sincere are welcome additions always.</p>
