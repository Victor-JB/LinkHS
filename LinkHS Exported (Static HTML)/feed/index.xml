										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3 id="mntl-sc-block_1-0-2" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text">Bad Luck or Good Luck?</span></h3>
<div id="mntl-sc-block_1-0-3" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html ">
<p>Here’s an example: Maureen Nelson. Maureen worked for Employer A, which was located across the street from Company B. Employer A was a contract position and Maureen needed benefits, so she went to B. Company B had buyer&#8217;s remorse after two months (Maureen never knew why) and she was asked to resign.</p>
</div>
<div id="mntl-sc-block_1-0-5" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html ">
<p>Maureen called Employer A back, and they said, &#8220;Great! Can you be here tomorrow morning at 9:00?&#8221; Because they were so close geographically, the commute was identical, and her routine hardly changed</p>
</div>
<div id="mntl-sc-block_1-0-7" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html ">
<p>The story gets better, though. Maureen explains,</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;The best part: A few months later, I was hired at Employer C, which paid me 30 percent more ($15K) than Employer B did! I actually moved for that job. It&#8217;s like the Chinese folk tale that starts with the horse running away &#8211; you never know, you never know &#8211; whether it&#8217;s good luck or bad luck.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
</div>
<h3 id="mntl-sc-block_1-0-11" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text">Doing All the Right Things</span></h3><div id="mntl-sc-block_1-0-12" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html ">
<p>Another person had done everything you should do when it came to both her job search and to evaluating a position at one of the top employers in the United States. She interviewed several times, researched the company, evaluated the job offer, and talked to her future co-workers and supervisor.</p>
</div>
<div id="mntl-sc-block_1-0-14" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html ">
<p>Presuming that she had made a good decision, she packed her bags and relocated to a new city to take what she thought was an exciting new job. Only it wasn&#8217;t. The position was nothing like anyone had described it.</p>
</div>
<div id="mntl-sc-block_1-0-16" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html ">
<p>The only explanation she got when she asked about the difference between the job she thought she was hired for and what she was doing, was that she could work her way up to more responsibility.</p>
</div>
<h3 id="mntl-sc-block_1-0-20" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text">Starting Your Job Search Over</span></h3>
<div id="mntl-sc-block_1-0-21" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html ">
<p>Unfortunately, luck doesn&#8217;t always work in your favor. Sometimes, the employer has filled the position or doesn&#8217;t want you back, and you’re either stuck with your new job or you’ll have to find something else.</p>
</div>
<div id="mntl-sc-block_1-0-23" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html ">
<p>For example, someone leaves his job for a new position. But he decides he hates his new job on the day he starts. He calls his old company to see if they’ll hire him back. However, he hadn’t performed as well at his old job as he should have so the company had looked at the resignation as an opportunity to start fresh with a new employee.</p>
</div>
<div id="mntl-sc-block_1-0-25" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html ">
<p>If going back to your old job isn&#8217;t an option, take some time to see if you were judging the job or the company in haste. Sometimes, our first impressions aren&#8217;t correct, and the job might be a better fit than you expected. Give it a chance and take some time to see if it&#8217;s as bad as you first thought.</p>
</div>
<div id="mntl-sc-block_1-0-27" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html ">
<p>If it really is that awful, start networking with your contacts and get your resume back into circulation. Be honest when you&#8217;re asked why you&#8217;re leaving a job you just started (and you will be).</p>
</div>
<div id="mntl-sc-block_1-0-29" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html ">
<p>Tell your contacts and the interviewer that the job wasn&#8217;t a good fit and you decided to pursue other options. You will probably need to provide details on why the position didn&#8217;t work out, so think about appropriate answers prior to interviewing. These sample interview answers on leaving your job may give you some ideas.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="mntl-sc-block_1-0-3" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html ">
<h3>What to Wear to a Job Interview</h3>
</div>
<p>Nothing says ‘Hire me’ like a Polished Interview Outfit – think Classic, Tasteful and Tailored, and you can’t go wrong, For men that often means a suit and tie, and for women a skirt/dress pants and blazer or dress. But dressing for an interview is not always so simple. But dressing for an interview is not always so simple.</p>
<p>putting together a killer interview outfit needs to take into consideration the culture of the organisation you’re interviewing with and the message you want to send. Someone interviewing to be a programmer at a tech start-up would probably dress a little differently from someone interviewing for a financial manager’s role.</p>
<h3>Choosing your interview outfit: find out what is appropriate</h3>
<p>Choosing your interview outfit is all about appropriateness for the role and the company. Dress codes are cultural, and they shift with the seasons and change over time – but as a general rule it’s wise to err on the side of caution. Interviews are not the place to push the sartorial envelope unless you really want to make a bold statement.</p>
<p>One of the best ways to clarify what to wear to a job interview is the simplest: <strong>ask beforehand</strong>.</p>
<p>Email or call the employer’s HR manager before your interview, and ask them about the appropriate dress code for interviews with their company. It’s a simple strategy, but it can help you to avoid overdressing or underdressing and ensure you hit the right note.</p>
<p>You could also do some company research on LinkedIn or Facebook. Check out employee profiles and office photos to see how they dress and present themselves. Whatever the dress code appears to be, the rule of thumb is to take it up a notch when you decide what to wear to the interview.</p>
<h3>General guidelines for what to wear to an interview</h3>
<p>More than anything, you want to present as a consummate professional with impeccable grooming – and impeccable grooming is defined by attention to detail. You need to consider every aspect of your appearance, and don’t leave it to the last minute.</p>
<p>Here are some details to consider when planning your interview outfit:</p>
<h4><strong>Style:</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ul>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ul>
<li>Think of the message you want to send: are you going to go full ‘power suit’ or do you want to give a more relaxed vibe with chinos/slacks and a nice shirt and blazer (this applies equally to men and women)?</li>
<li>Wear colours that suit you and give some thought to the message they send: blue is considered a safe and ‘dependable’ colour, while bright colours make a bold statement that might be more appropriate in creative roles and industries. Avoid overly busy or shiny clothes.</li>
<li>Choose breathable fabrics that will keep you cool and dry.</li>
</ul>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3>Resume Writing Do&#8217;s and Don&#8217;ts</h3>
<ul>
<li>DON’T use multi-coloured text or too many different font sizes. Italics, underlining, shading, graphics and vertical/horizontal lines or boxes are also best avoided. DO keep your resume length to a minimum – two or three pages is ideal.Verdana, Arial, Calibri or Times.</li>
<li>DON’T include personal details such as your date of birth, marital status or photo (unless you are applying for a job where these are relevant).</li>
<li>DO include a link to your website, if you have one (and if it’s related to your work). Whether it’s a website or blog, or a Twitter, LinkedIn or Instagram account, an online presence can really boost your image and get you taken more seriously, especially for careers in the media, creative industries and IT.</li>
<li>DON’T make vague statements. Give facts context by backing them up with real examples. For instance, don’t just say, “I have excellent communication skills”. Instead, say: “My excellent communication skills have been fine-tuned by… and proved invaluable when…”</li>
<li>DO, wherever possible, quantify your achievements. If you can say, for example, “increased sales by $50,000”, “reduced turnover by 34%” or “increased website traffic by 125%” rather than making a more general claim, that will give your assertions more weight and clarity.</li>
<li>DON’T use a PDF format for your resume, especially for less IT-heavy industries, as some software won’t be able to read it easily. Most companies prefer Word (.doc/.docx) files wherever possible.</li>
<li>DO use testimonials from previous employers. Consider adding them to your resume as hyperlinks, linking them to an employer testimonial on your LinkedIn profile or website (if you have one).</li>
<li>DON’T forget to tailor your resume for each job application. The more precisely you address each of the criteria for the particular job, demonstrating how you fit and satisfy the criteria, the greater your chances of making the shortlist.</li>
<li>DO proofread and spell-check – and check again. A recent CareerBuilder survey found that 58 per cent of resumes contain typos. Make sure yours isn’t one of them! If you’re often going back and tweaking or updating your resume, typos, spelling mistakes and formatting issues can creep in. Doing so can easily create a mismatched subject and verb or knock a sentence out of alignment. Re-read the resume in its entirety each time you make an amendment.</li>
</ul>

<blockquote><p>Cras pharetra, risus vel lacinia dictum, augue orci ornare erat, varius porta massa ligula id urna. Maecenas sagittis ut sem sit amet interdum.

<h3>Can you fix it now?</h3>
<p>If you decide that you love what you do but just want a better work-life balance or more money, could you get these things at your current workplace?</p>
<p>If possible, it’s worth sitting down with your manager and sharing your thoughts.</p>
<p>If you are concerned about the lack of challenge and career progression, could you ask for training and widen your work scope? Could you negotiate a pay increase?</p>
<p>By speaking to your manager, you will be able to uncover if your needs can be met where you are. Alternatively, you may find there is no other option but to leave.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When you’re considering a job offer, there’s more to think about than just how much you are going to be paid. Salary is, of course, important, and it could be the deciding factor in accepting a job offer.</p>
<p>However, the other parts of a compensation package are almost as important. Your paycheck will cover your monthly bills, but you also need to consider employee benefits, perks and the non-tangible things that make a job a good one.</p>
<p>Here are some things to consider before accepting a job offer, including what to look for when evaluating job offers, and when it can make sense to turn one down</p>
<ul>
<li class="TrT0Xe">Evaluate the <b>Job Offer</b>.</li>
<li class="TrT0Xe">Evaluate Employee Benefits and Perks.</li>
<li class="TrT0Xe">Get a Good Retirement Plan.</li>
<li class="TrT0Xe">Evaluate Stock Options.</li>
<li class="TrT0Xe">Ask for More Time.</li>
<li class="TrT0Xe">Negotiate Salary.</li>
<li class="TrT0Xe">Negotiate a Counter <b>Offer</b>.</li>
<li class="TrT0Xe">When To Turn Down a <b>Job Offer</b>.</li>
</ul>
<h3><span class="content-list__text">Evaluate the Job Offer</span></h3>

<p>Before you say yes, you’ll take the job, consider the entire compensation package &#8211; salary, benefits, perks, work environment, the schedule and the hours.  Also, consider the job description and if you would be happy working at this job with this company.</p>
<p>Weigh the pros and cons and take some time to think about the offer. You don’t have to say yes right away if you are going to accept. Ask the employer when they need a response by. If you have two offers to consider, use a comparison list to help you decide which one to accept.</p>
<h3 class="content-list__title"><span class="content-list__text">Evaluate Employee Benefits and Perks</span></h3>
<p>Employee benefits, including health insurance, retirement plans, vacation and sick leave, and life and disability insurance can represent up to 30% of your compensation package. It&#8217;s important to take the time to review what you&#8217;re offered to make sure it&#8217;s what you and your family need at this stage of your working life.</p>
<h3 class="content-list__title"><span class="content-list__text">Get a Good Retirement Plan</span></h3>
<p>Not all retirement plans are created equal. A great retirement plan can significantly increase the value of a job offer, and may even trump higher salary at another employer. Review these guidelines for what constitutes a good retirement plan, so you can compare what you may have already with what you’re being offered.</p>
<h3 class="content-list__title"><span class="content-list__text">How to Accept or Decline a Job Offer</span></h3>
<p>Once you have made a decision on whether to accept or decline the offer, it&#8217;s time to let the employer know. Take the time to formally accept or turn down the position, and do it gracefully so you don&#8217;t burn any bridges with the prospective employer.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="lead">Working alone is difficult, but group work is even more challenging. Alone, you can make instantaneous decisions and changes without having to worry about how it will affect other persons. However, group work and by extension, group discussion is a part of every aspect of our lives, and we cannot push it under the rug, hoping it goes away. So what now? How can you prepare yourself to be a good team player and have positive and engaging group discussions with members of your team? This article will give you some pointers on how to develop your skills and be productive during group discussions.</p>
<h5><strong>Prepare</strong></h5>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="size-medium wp-image-116 alignright" src="https://elementor.nokriwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/pexels-photo-1043514-1-288x300.jpeg" alt="" width="288" height="300" /></p>
<p>Firstly, even before you meet with the group, you must prepare yourself for the discussion. It makes no sense arriving to discuss about a topic, and you have no idea what the topic is about. Do your research, read reviews and see what other persons are saying about the topic and make notes. Arm yourself with the knowledge you need to support and defend any points which may arise during the discussion. This also shows that you are prepared to engage in wholesome discussion and not just coming to the meeting because you feel obligated.</p>
<h5><strong>Be Punctual</strong></h5>
<p>On the day of the meeting, be early! It sets an unprofessional tone when you show up late for a meeting. It sends a message to other members that the discussion is meaningless and an inconvenience to your daily schedule. Dress comfortably but appropriate for the meeting so you don’t focus on how much your feet hurt or how badly you want to take off this tie, but you are engaged and focused on the discussion.</p>
<h5><strong>Listen</strong></h5>
<p>We hear, but we do not listen. Many persons neglect to admit that listening is an art which they don’t possess. Listening is of utmost importance when doing group discussions and it can help to avoid repetition of points which is ultimately a waste of time. When meeting with the group, before any discussion starts everyone should state their interpretation of the topic. Often, persons start out with a misguided idea about what the topic is about, and this leads to complications further into the discussion. Members need to express their thoughts on the topic so everyone can begin the discussion on the same page.</p>
<h5><strong>Give everyone a voice</strong></h5>
<p>Getting into the actual discussion, group members must remember that being respectful is most important and that opinions and facts are two different things. Persons tend to get frustrated when their voice isn’t heard or when others seem to be dismissive of their views. A good discussion requires a mutual level of respect by everyone involved, and to continue to be respectful even if there are disagreements.</p>
<p>To quote <strong>Brandon Jenner</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>Sometimes we let life guide us, and other times we take life by the horns. But one thing is for sure: no matter how organized we are, or how well we plan, we can always expect the unexpected</p></blockquote>
<h5><strong>Take the Initiative</strong></h5>
<p>Taking the initiative is also a good way to improve the performance in group discussions. At times, a task may come up, and it needs to be delegated to a member to be completed, in some cases for the discussion to move forward. Stepping up to the challenge is a good way to show your ability to get the job done as well as flexing your leadership muscles. This allows persons to see you in a different setting and also gives you the opportunity to showcase your skills.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Have you ever hired someone who did not live up to your expectations? Have you ever hired someone who greatly [&#8230;]]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="lead">Have you ever hired someone who did not live up to your expectations? Have you ever hired someone who greatly exceeded your expectations? How different were your hiring processes in each case? If you’re like most employers – the process used in each case was the same! (You just got lucky – or unlucky!)</p>
<p>What would it mean to your business (and your sanity!) if your company was chock full of great employees? Does this sound like an impossible dream? It’s not! So how can we increase the odds of hiring great people – every time?</p>
<p>We can start by avoiding the three most common hiring mistakes:</p>
<h4><strong>Mistake #1: The Company lacks a systematic, fundamentally sound approach to hiring that is used consistently.</strong></h4>
<p>Through the years companies have upgraded and modernised many of their business processes – such as inventory management, project management, technical design – but their hiring processes have remained static – run an ad, do some (unstructured) interviews, hire. The odds of getting the right person this way are about 14% – you could flip a coin and get better results!</p>
<h4><strong>Mistake #2: Hiring based on emotion rather than objective criteria.</strong></h4>
<p>Sometimes a hiring decision is based on the warm body approach – we need somebody right away – you breathe, you’re hired! Hiring decisions are often based simply on whether or not the interviewer likes the person – I like you, you’re hired! And sometimes the decision to hire is made because the candidate was outstanding in the interview – wow! – You’re hired!</p>
<p>The problem with these emotional approaches is that the chances of hiring a great employee are very low. You may desperately need to fill a position right away in order to get the work done, but if you hire the wrong person, the time you saved in hiring that person immediately will end up costing you a lot more in time and money. Develop a process</p>
<h4><strong>Mistake #3: The position is not clearly defined and the job description is not compelling</strong>.</h4>
<p>In order to attract superior people, superior performance must first be defined and built into the job description. This is done through a performance profile, which emphasizes what a person must do to be <em>successful</em> in the job. This differs from the traditional job description which is based on experience, skills, and education. Average performers have the right skills and qualifications – superior performers can do the job at a superior level! Basing your job description on specific performance objectives improves the quality of the applicants for your position, and improves the objectivity of your screening and interviewing processes.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[General work rules often considered Choosing a simple set of work regulations made up of a few generally accepted as [&#8230;]]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h4><strong>General work rules often considered</strong></h4>
<p>Choosing a simple set of work regulations made up of a few generally accepted as well as prohibited conducts is much advised. In place of a lengthy set of regulations, small businesses are advised to go for a simple list of regulations and guidelines for making it clear to the workers what sort of behaviour was expected from their part.</p>
<h4><strong>Here is a set of simple set of general workplace rules</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>Safety rules to be observed</li>
<li>Tardiness policy explaining the way to report the number of sick days allowable and personal off days erased</li>
<li>Time of work to be recorded (Using a time sheet or clock)</li>
<li>Rules of the lunch period and other breaks</li>
<li>Policy for overtime</li>
<li>Rules regarding personal appearance including dress code</li>
<li>Employer’s property damage rules</li>
<li>Rules on maintaining sensitive information of the employers as well as the customers</li>
</ul>
<p>To quote from Michelle Obama</p>
<blockquote><p>We learned about honesty and integrity &#8211; that the truth matters&#8230; that you don&#8217;t take shortcuts or play by your own set of rules&#8230; and success doesn&#8217;t count unless you earn it fair and square.</p></blockquote>
<h4><strong>As a defence against wrongful discharge claims</strong></h4>
<p>Even for at-will employers that have greater freedom for allowing workers to leave for avoiding legal hassles involved with termination procedures, the reasoning of any such action should be wanted to be sound as well as defensible. One way to ensure this is by having a number of basic and vividly stated employees’ rules well communicated to the workers. By this, any worker breaking a work rule ends up doing so with the knowledge that his conduct is not acceptable and such conduct might end up in inviting termination.</p>
<h4><strong>Safeguard step from discrimination claims</strong></h4>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignright wp-image-89 size-medium" src="https://elementor.nokriwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/pexels-photo-70292-1-288x300.jpeg" alt="" width="288" height="300" /></p>
<p>If a worker is fired or disciplined on grounds of breaking general employee regulations, even while another one is spared despite facing similar charges, the business could be violating regulations based on anti-discrimination. Maintaining a clear list of work rules makes sure that all workers understand the acceptable and unacceptable behaviour. If the rule set in this regard is ambiguous carrying out of such a rule could invite challenge as discriminatory or arbitrary which is important.even while another one is spared despite facing similar charges</p>
<h4><strong>Points to ponder while choosing work rules</strong></h4>
<h5>Quality of work can be improved by work rules when</h5>
<ul>
<li>An atmosphere is created where workers are treated with respect and dignity</li>
<li>Employees are helped to ensure their own conduct in a safe as well as professional manner</li>
<li>Open communication between the business and its employees are encouraged</li>
<li>All workers are ensured fair treatment and a common set of regulation to follow</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>Work rules to selected reasonably and appropriately</strong></h4>
<p>Finally, while the conduct of all employees is expected to be governed by certain rules based on work, the specific rules chosen are expected to be reasonable and appropriate for the work being done by the employees in question alongside the working conditions where they are placed in.</p>

<li>
<h4>Flеxіbіlіtу</h4>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Thеrе’ѕ no such thіng as “thе perfect rеѕumе.” An еxреrt саn take a good tеmрlаtе аnd make some twеаkѕ hеrе аnd thеrе tо mаtсh hіѕ оr hеr nееdѕ. It may require аdjuѕtіng some оf thе formatting or inserting lоngеr ѕесtіоnѕ than the resume wаѕ designed fоr. Thіѕ kіnd оf flexibility allows more сrеаtіvіtу аnd specificity іn thе text. Fоr еxаmрlе, most rеѕumе experts rесоmmеnd уоu dіtсh the оbjесtіvе statement, but templates ѕtіll іnсludе one аt thе tор оf thе page. Whеn you аdjuѕt thе fоrmаttіng, lеаd wіth a modern, сарtіvаtіng ѕummаrу instead of an оld-hаt objective statement.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<h4>Dеѕіgn toward the job</h4>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Aѕ a general rule, resumes tеnd to bе fаіrlу plain. Mоѕt аrе wrіttеn wіth blасk tеxt аnd vеrу lіttlе соlоr. Thіѕ ѕtуlе іѕ rесоmmеndеd fоr rеgulаr оffісе jоbѕ, wrіtеrѕ, medical professions, and mаnу оthеr nо-frіll career trасkѕ. But thаt dоеѕn’t mеаn a tеmрlаtе wіth a little more соlоr and сhаrасtеr wоn’t реrfоrm well іn thе rіght ѕеttіng. If you’re applying fоr a grарhіс dеѕіgn роѕіtіоn, it’s оnе thing tо ѕtаtе you’re a сrеаtіvе designer and another tо ѕhоw іt with your rеѕumе.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<h4>Aсtіоnаblе guіdеѕ</h4>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Gооd tеmрlаtеѕ wіll аlѕо guіdе you thrоugh thе resume-building рrосеѕѕ, which is ѕресіаllу useful іf уоu’rе nеw to the рrосеѕѕ оf buіldіng аn еffесtіvе rеѕumе. Thе guіdе wіll wаlk уоu thrоugh thе process, with captions thаt tеll you whаt tо wrіtе in еасh рrоvіdеd fіеld. It also provides a tооlbаr that рrоvіdеѕ tірѕ аѕ you go аlоng. It mіght ѕuggеѕt quantifying a ѕtаtеmеnt оr using ѕtrоngеr vеrbѕ. It ѕhоuld аlѕо рrоvіdе lіnkѕ tо further resources both оnlіnе аnd іn your wоrd рrосеѕѕоr. Nоt all resume tеmрlаtеѕ wіll have this аdvаnсеd feature, but thоѕе thаt dо are іnсrеdіblу handy.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<h4>Stаnd-Out fеаturеѕ</h4>
</li>
</ul>
<p>According tо ѕtudіеѕ, thе аvеrаgе jоb posting receives 200 аррlісаtіоnѕ. In оrdеr to “sift thrоugh” аll the саndіdаtеѕ аnd mаkе a quаlіfіеd hіrе wіthіn a reasonable time frаmе, thе аvеrаgе еmрlоуеr аllоtѕ juѕt ѕіx ѕесоndѕ tо ѕсаn each rеѕumе. If іt stands out оr ѕееmѕ like a vіаblе орtіоn, thе ѕіftеr put it in thе “mауbе” ріlе for a ѕесоnd rеvіеw lаtеr on. Others get trаѕhеd.</p>
<p>If you hope to get in for further rеvіеw, ѕоmеthіng оn your resume has tо саtсh the еуе in thоѕе ѕіx ѕесоndѕ. Thіѕ dоеѕn’t nесеѕѕаrіlу mean a hugе fоnt fоr your nаmе or bright-coloured wаtеr in thе foreground. When uѕеd in thе wrong ѕеttіng, such fеаturеѕ саn get уоur rеѕumе ѕhrеddеd іnѕtаntlу. Stand-out elements іnсludе uniquely ѕhареd bullеt роіntѕ, a роwеr-hоuѕе fоnt lіkе Gеоrgіа fоr уоur name, mаxіmіzеd space, and applicable design fеаturеѕ іf you’re applying fоr a mоrе сrеаtіvе position.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<h4>Formatting орtіоnѕ</h4>
</li>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="lead">It is quite easy to be swept over the feet by a fresh job offer. The job offer reflects the fact that someone requires the person’s service and is willing to pay him for that. No wonder if the candidate feels a bit of giddiness or even fit of excitement. But this is also the moment to ponder over the point what else is being offered by the recruiter. There are in fact several factors one really ought to consider prior to accepting a fresh job offer. Discussed below are a few points that people generally tend to miss taking into account when it comes to adding the fresh company to their resume.</p>
<h3>What is the catch?</h3>
<p>People generally tend to take into account what they would in effect, have to sacrifice to fulfil their fresh duties when it comes to accepting the new job. A fresh role whatever it may be means fresh responsibilities that may involve the candidate’s making amendments to his social calendar accordingly. Therefore the candidate is better advised to be in a position to be informed of what he would have to pay in return for success and if the so earned success really viable.</p>
<p>To quote vince lombardi,</p>
<blockquote><p>The price of success is hard <b>work</b>, dedication to the <b>job</b> at hand, and the determination that whether we win or lose, we have applied the best of ourselves to the task at hand</p></blockquote>
<h3>Being in the right work environment</h3>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="size-medium wp-image-45 alignright" src="https://demo.nokriwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/pexels-photo-935756-288x300.jpeg" alt="" width="288" height="300" /></p><p>Prior to accepting a job offer, the candidate in question is advised to meet a few of his colleagues from the new workplace. As the same persons, he would be spending more than forty hours a week at a common workplace it is surely essential to be amicable with them. This is absolutely crucial as a wrong work environment can prove to be damaging for the career of the person. Making a continuous effort to get oneself introduced to the environment even before accepting the position could pay rich dividends rather than taking a leap of blind faith into the fresh offer.</p>
<h3>Let the new job come with some juice for the resume</h3>
<p>A good promising fresh job is not just all about a healthy salary package and sound environment. It must also accommodate something that would open up the candidate to other opportunities. These could be the space to gain more knowledge or the scope to develop within a certain industry. The opportunity part would also pack with it the promise of a stepping stone to the candidate for achieving greater things in the future.</p>
